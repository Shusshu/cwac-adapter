CWAC AdapterWrapper: Adding Bits o' Functionality
=================================================

Android comes with a few "wrapper" classes, like `CursorWrapper`,
that make it relatively easy for you to add just a bit of
functionality to an existing object. The wrapper delegates
all behaviors to the wrapped object; you just override the
specific behaviors you need. This works well in cases where
there are many possible underlying implementations, so you
could not robustly accomplish these ends by subclassing.

Android lacks such a wrapper for `ListAdapter`, though. There
is a `WrappedListAdapter` entry in the SDK, but it is an interface,
not an implementation.

So, CWAC offers an `AdapterWrapper` to fill this void.

By itself, it is not terribly interesting. However, other CWAC
projects, like [`EndlessAdapter`][endless], take advantage of it.

This is packaged as an Android library project, though
[a simple JAR is also available](https://github.com/commonsguy/downloads).

Usage
-----
Just extend `AdapterWrapper` and override whatever adapter-related
methods you wish. By default, all adapter methods delegate to the
wrapped adapter. Your code can get at the wrapped adapter by
calling `getWrappedAdapter()`.

Dependencies
------------
None at present.

Version
-------
This is version v1.0 of this module. And there was much rejoicing.

Demo
----
There is no demo project. Please refer to
[`EndlessAdapter`][endless] for an example of using this class.
